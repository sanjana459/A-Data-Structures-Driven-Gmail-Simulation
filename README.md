# A-Data-Structures-Driven-Gmail-Simulation
The practical application of data structures in the development of a simplified email management system, akin to Gmail. The project was implemented using C++ and aimed to demonstrate the effective utilization of data structures in managing user accounts, messages, and various associated actions.

Description of my Gmail-like application built in C++ with a focus on the use of data structures:

**User Accounts Management:**

•	Utilizes a doubly linked list to efficiently manage user accounts.

•	Allows users to create new accounts with unique usernames and passwords.

•	Implements a login system for registered users to access their accounts.



**Message Storage:**

•	Employs two singly linked lists per user, one for storing sent messages and another for received messages.

•	Provides a structured data storage system for users to manage their correspondence.

•	Each message contains information such as sender, recipient, message content, timestamp, and message status (e.g., starred or deleted).



**User Actions:**

•	Enables logged-in users to perform a variety of actions, including:

•	Sending messages to other existing users.

•	Logging out from the current account.

•	Creating new accounts or logging into existing ones.

•	Changing the password of an existing account.

•	Deleting an existing account.



**Message Management:**

•	Users can perform several operations on their messages, such as:

•	Viewing a list of received, sent, deleted, and starred messages.

•	Searching for messages sent to or received from a specific user.

•	Reading the content of messages.

•	Deleting messages.

•	Marking messages as important (starred) or removing the star.

•	Permanently deleting messages from the trash.

•	Viewing messages in the trash.



**Message Retrieval and Search:**

•	Uses sequential search algorithms to find messages that meet specific criteria, such as sender, recipient, or message status.

•	When a message satisfies the search criteria, its reference is stored in a vector, allowing users to perform actions on these filtered messages efficiently.

This application's use of data structures, including doubly linked lists, singly linked lists, and vectors, ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of user accounts and messages. These data structures enable users to have a seamless and organized experience within the email-like application.
